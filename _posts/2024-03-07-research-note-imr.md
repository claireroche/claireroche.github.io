This  work  aims  to  provide  a  method  to  generate  block-structured meshes suitable for Computational Fluid Dynamics  (CFD)  simulations  of  flows  around  vehicles  during  atmospheric re-entry.  This method takes as input a tetrahedral mesh of the domain, and the quadrangular block discretization  of  the  vehicle  surface. A linear blocking  is  obtained  using  an  advancing  front  algorithm. This  means  it is  incrementally  created  from  the  vehicle  surface,  layer  by layer. Then, this linear blocking is curved, and we generate the final mesh.  Some results of blocking and corresponding meshes generated with our algorithm are shown.
