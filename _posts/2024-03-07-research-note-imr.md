##### SIAM International Meshing Roundtable Workshop 2024 (SIAM IMR 2024), Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

This  work  aims  to  provide  a  method  to  generate  block-structured meshes suitable for Computational Fluid Dynam-ics  (CFD)  simulations  of  flows  around  vehicles  during  at-mospheric re-entry.  This method takes as input a tetrahe-dral mesh of the domain,  and the quadrangular block dis-cretization  of  the  vehicle  surface.   A  linear  blocking  is  ob-tained  using  an  advancing  front  algorithm.   This  means  itis  incrementally  created  from  the  vehicle  surface,  layer  bylayer.  Then, this linear blocking is curved, and we generatethe final mesh.  Some results of blocking and correspondingmeshes generated with our algorithm are shown.
