Ph.D student at CEA working on generation of 3d hexahedral mesh for atmospheric re-entry.

This thesis aims to provide a method to generate automatic hexahedral block-structured mesh dedicated to a Computational Fluid Dynamics code, developed for atmospheric re-entry.
These simulations require a very strong control of cell size and direction. To our knowledge, these meshes are generated by hand with dedicated software and take a huge amount of time.
In this work, under conditions on the physical domains, we develop an algorithm to generate these meshes most automatically.
