Ph.D student at CEA working on generation of 3D hexahedral mesh for atmospheric re-entry.

This thesis aims to provide a method to generate automatic hexahedral block-structured mesh dedicated to a Computational Fluid Dynamics code, developed for atmospheric re-entry.
These simulations require a very strong control of cell size and direction. To our knowledge, these meshes are generated by hand with dedicated software and take a huge amount of time.
In this work, under conditions on the physical domains, we develop an algorithm to generate these meshes most automatically.  

The following animation aims to demonstrate the different steps of the algorithm developed during my PhD to generate block-structured meshes suitable for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of flows around vehicles during atmospheric re-entry.
